# ToDo-App.
A Java GUI To-Do application provides a graphical user interface for users to manage their tasks. These applications typically allow users to create, view, edit, mark as complete, and delete tasks. They can be built using various Java GUI toolkits, primarily Swing or JavaFX.
Common Features and Components:
Task Management:
Core functionality includes adding new tasks, displaying existing tasks, editing task details (e.g., title, due date, priority), marking tasks as done or incomplete, and removing tasks.
User Interface:
Task Display: Tasks are often displayed in a list or table format, allowing for easy viewing and interaction.
Input Fields: Text fields or areas for entering task titles and descriptions.
Buttons: Buttons for actions like "Add Task," "Edit," "Delete," "Mark Complete," etc.
Date Pickers: For selecting due dates for tasks.
Data Persistence:
To ensure tasks are saved between application sessions, the application typically stores data in:
Files: Simple text files or serialized objects for basic storage.
Error Handling and Validation:
Implementing checks to prevent invalid input and provide informative messages to the user.
GUI Toolkits:
Java Swing:
A mature and widely used GUI toolkit for building desktop applications. It provides a rich set of components (buttons, text fields, tables, etc.) for creating graphical interfaces.
JavaFX:
A more modern GUI toolkit that offers advanced features, including richer graphics, CSS styling, and FXML for declarative UI design.
Development Considerations:
Event Handling:
Implementing listeners to respond to user interactions (e.g., button clicks, text input)
